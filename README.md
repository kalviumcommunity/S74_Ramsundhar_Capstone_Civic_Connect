# Project Title: Public Query & Community Issue Reporter

Brief Overview: 
The Public Query & Community Issue Reporter is a web-based platform designed to facilitate direct communication between citizens and government authorities. It enables the public to report local issues, track their resolution, and participate in community-driven initiatives. The system also empowers government officials with an organized interface to manage and address reported concerns efficiently. The platform includes a voting feature where citizens can propose local projects and collectively vote on initiatives they support.
By fostering transparency and engagement, this platform aims to improve governance, encourage civic participation, and ensure timely resolution of community issues.

# Key Features:

# Public User Features:
Issue Reporting: Users can submit local problems such as road damage, waste management issues, public safety concerns, and more.

Issue Tracking: Citizens can monitor the progress of submitted issues, view updates from officials, and receive notifications on resolutions.

Community Initiatives: Users can propose local initiatives (e.g., park clean-ups, tree-planting drives) and participate in a democratic voting system to prioritize impactful projects.

Public Discussion & Engagement: A comment and discussion section allows users to share opinions, suggest solutions, and collaborate on resolving issues.

User Dashboard: Provides an overview of submitted issues, statuses, and community engagement activities.

Voting Feature:

Users can propose initiatives that benefit the community.

Citizens can vote on proposed projects, allowing officials to prioritize initiatives that have strong public backing.

Transparent display of voting results to maintain fairness and community trust.



# Government Official Features:

Issue Management Dashboard: Government officials have access to new and old issues, categorized by priority, location, and type.

Status Updates & Progress Tracking: Officials can update issue statuses (Pending, In Progress, Resolved) and provide detailed responses.

Citizen Feedback & Response Management: Enables direct interaction with citizens to clarify issues and gather additional information if required.

Performance Metrics & Reports: Officials can view analytics on reported issues, resolution times, and community participation.

# Authentication & Authorization:

Role-Based Access Control: Users must register as either 'Public' or 'Government Official,' granting them access to relevant features.

Secure Login & Signup: Authentication will be implemented using JWT (JSON Web Token) to ensure secure access control.

Admin Role (Optional Future Expansion): A super-admin role could be introduced to oversee both public users and officials, ensuring accountability and efficiency.




# Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js (for a dynamic and responsive UI)

Backend: Node.js with Express.js (to handle API requests and server-side logic)

Database: MongoDB (for efficient data storage and retrieval)

Authentication: JWT-based authentication (ensuring secure user access)

Real-time Notifications: WebSockets or Firebase for live status updates on reported issues

Hosting & Deployment: Cloud-based solutions such as Vercel (Frontend), AWS or Heroku (Backend), and MongoDB Atlas (Database)

# Future Enhancements (Optional):

Mobile App Integration: Extend functionality to mobile platforms for on-the-go issue reporting.

AI-based Issue Categorization: Use machine learning to categorize and prioritize reported issues automatically.

Automated Reminders & Escalations: Notify officials if an issue remains unresolved beyond a certain timeframe.
